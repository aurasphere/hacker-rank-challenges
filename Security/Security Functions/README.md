## Problem

Before we jump into security concepts, let us familiarize ourselves with the mathematical background required for it.

Set <code>X</code> is a collection of elements. Here, <code>X = {1,2,3}</code> is one such example. A collection of integers is also a set.

Given two sets, <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, we define a function <code>f</code> that maps every element in <code>X</code> to precisely <code>1</code> element in <code>Y</code>.

If <code>X = {1,2,3}</code> and <code>Y = {a,b,c}</code>, the function <code>f</code> will return:

<code>f(1) = a</code>, <code>f(2) = b</code> and <code>f(3) = c</code>.

Let us define a function <code>f(x) = y</code>, where <code>x in X</code> and <code>y in Y</code>. 
Here, <code>y</code> is defined as the remainder of <code>x</code> when divided by <code>11</code>.

Your task is to complete the function that takes the input <code>x</code> and returns <code>y</code>.

## Constraints

     1 <= x <= 1000
